 **Python Logical Programs**

This repository contains **6 logical Python programs** that help in understanding basic Python concepts like input handling, arithmetic operations, and control structures.

## **Programs Overview**

### **1️⃣ Add Two Numbers (`01_add_two_numbers.py`)**
📌 **Description:**  
- This program takes two numbers as input and prints their sum.  
- It demonstrates how to handle user input and perform basic arithmetic operations.  

🔹 **Concepts Used:** Input handling, type conversion, arithmetic operators.  

---

### **2️⃣ Agreement Bot (`02_agreement_bot.py`)**
📌 **Description:**  
- A simple bot that asks the user a yes/no question and responds accordingly.  
- It ensures that the input is correctly interpreted and validates user responses.  

🔹 **Concepts Used:** Conditional statements (`if-else`), string comparison, user input.  

---

### **3️⃣ Fahrenheit to Celsius Converter (`03_fahrenheit_to_celsius.py`)**
📌 **Description:**  
- This program converts a given Fahrenheit temperature to Celsius using the formula:  
  \[
  C = \frac{(F - 32) \times 5}{9}
  \]
- It helps understand mathematical operations in Python.  

🔹 **Concepts Used:** Arithmetic operations, mathematical formulas, input handling.

### **4️⃣ Age Calculator (`04_how_old_are_they.py`)**
📌 **Description:**  
- The program calculates the age of a person based on their birth year.  
- It takes the current year and birth year as input and computes the difference.  

🔹 **Concepts Used:** Subtraction, integer operations, user input.  

---

### **5️⃣ Triangle Perimeter Calculator (`05_triangle_perimeter.py`)**
📌 **Description:**  
- This program calculates the perimeter of a triangle given its three side lengths.  
- The perimeter is the sum of all three sides.  

🔹 **Concepts Used:** Arithmetic operations, variable handling.  

---

### **6️⃣ Square of a Number (`06_square_number.py`)**
📌 **Description:**  
- The program asks the user for a number and prints its square.  
- It ensures correct numeric input handling and displays results with formatting.  

🔹 **Concepts Used:** Exponentiation (`**` operator), error handling (`try-except`).
